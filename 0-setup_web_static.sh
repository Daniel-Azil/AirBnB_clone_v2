#!/usr/bin/env bash

# A Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of web_static. It must:

# Install Nginx if it not already installed
# Create the folder /data/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/shared/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
# Create a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
# Create a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and recreated every time the script is ran.
# Give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be created/owned by this user/group
